## Abstract

"Data science project: an inductive learning approach" provides a comprehensive
methodology for data science project development, emphasizing software
engineering principles essential for reliable solutions.

Prof. Dr. Filipe Verri, a senior data science project manager and professor at
the Aeronautics Institute of Technology (ITA), guides readers through the
origins, scope, and key concepts of data science.

This book covers machine learning, data handling, and rigorous validation
techniques, all essential for preparing readers to tackle complex, real-world
projects.

Contributions from Prof. Dr. Johnny Marques, also professor at ITA and an
expert in critical software development, bring an industry-tested perspective
to the software aspects, making this an essential guide for aspiring data
scientists, researchers and seasoned professionals alike.
