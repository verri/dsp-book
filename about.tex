\chapter{Preface}

\noindent Dear reader, \vspace{1em}

This book has started from the lectures notes of the course PO-235 Data Science Project
that I teach for graduate students at the Aeronautics Institute of Technology (ITA) in
Brazil.  I have been teaching this course since 2023, and I have been improving the
material every year.

Before that, I was the coordinator of the Data Science Specialization Program (CEDS) at
ITA.  That experience, which included lots of administrative work, but also teaching and
supervising professionals in the course, has helped me to understand the needs of the
market and the students.

Literature provides us a lot of great theoretical books on machine learning and
statistics, and excellent practical books on data science tools.  However, I missed
something that could provide a solid foundation on data science, covering all steps in a
data science project, including its software engineering aspects.

My goal is to provide a book that can be used as a textbook for a course on data science
projects or as a reference for professionals working in the field.  I try to be as
formal as possible, without losing the practical aspects of the subject.  Also, I do not
focus on a specific tool or programming language, but I try to explain the semantics of
data science tasks that can be implemented in any programming language.

Also, instead of teaching specific machine learning algorithms, I try to explain why
machine learning works, increasing awareness of its pitfalls and limitations.
For that, I assume you have a strong mathematical and statistics background.

One important artificial constraint I have imposed in the material (for the sake of the
course) is that I only consider \emph{predictive methods}, more specifically inductive
ones.  I do not address topics such as clustering, association-rules mining, transductive
learning, anomaly detection, time series forecasting, reinforced learning, etc.

I expect my approach on the subject to provide understanding of all steps in a data science
project including a deeper focus on correct evaluation and validation of data science
solutions.

Note that, in this book, I openly express my opinions and beliefs. Many times it might sound
controvertial.  I am not trying to be rude or to demean any researcher or practitioner in the
field.  I am just trying to be honest and transparent.

Hope you enjoy the reading.
