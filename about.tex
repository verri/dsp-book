\chapter{Preface}

\noindent Dear reader, \vspace{1em}

This book is based on the lecture notes from my course PO-235 Data Science Project, which
I teach to graduate students at both the Aeronautics Institute of Technology (ITA) and the
Federal University of SÃ£o Paulo (UNIFESP) in Brazil.  I have been teaching this subject
since 2021, and I have continually updated the material each year.

Also, I was the coordinator of the Data Science Specialization Program (CEDS) at ITA.
That experience, which included a great deal of administrative work, as well as teaching and
supervising professionals in the course, has helped me to understand the needs of the
market and the students.

Moreover, parts of the project development methodology presented here came from my
experience as a lead data scientist in R\&D projects for the Brazilian Air Force,
which included projects in areas such as image processing, natural language processing,
and spatio-temporal data analysis.

Literature provides us with a wide range of excellent theoretical material on machine learning and
statistics, and highly regarded practical books on data science tools.  However, I missed
something that could provide a solid foundation on data science, covering all steps in a
data science project, including its software engineering aspects.

My goal is to provide a book that serves as a textbook for a course on data science
projects or as a reference for professionals working in the field.  I strive to maintain a
formal tone while preserving the practical aspects of the subject.  I do not focus on
a specific tool or programming language, but rather seek to explain the semantics of data
science tasks that can be implemented in any programming language.

Also, instead of teaching specific machine learning algorithms, I try to explain why
machine learning works, thereby increasing awareness of its pitfalls and limitations.
For this purpose, I assume you have a strong mathematical and statistical foundation.

One important artificial constraint I have imposed in the material (for the sake of the
course) is that I only consider predictive methods, more specifically inductive ones. I do
not address topics such as clustering, association rule mining, transductive learning,
anomaly detection, time series forecasting, reinforcement learning, etc.

I expect my approach on the subject to provide understanding of all steps in a data
science project, including a deeper focus on correct evaluation and validation of data
science solutions.

Note that, in this book, I openly express my opinions and beliefs. On several occasions it
may sound controversial.  I am not trying to be rude or to demean any researcher or
practitioner in the field; rather, I aim to be honest and transparent.

I hope you enjoy reading.
