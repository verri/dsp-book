\chapter{Course plan}

In the following, I present the course plan for PO-235 and CMC-16.

Any questions about the classes should be sent via Google Classroom.  If your query is of
general interest, please use the main channel.  If your query is personal and related to
a specific assignment or grade, please use the private stream.

\emph{Course plan (\the\year{})}

Prof. Filipe A. N. Verri

\paragraph{Important:} Only graduate students are permitted to enroll in this course.

\paragraph{Number of students:} Approx. 20

\paragraph{Course load:} 3--0--0--4

\paragraph{Requirements:} Advanced programming skills, strong statistical background, and
beginner-level machine-learning skills.

\paragraph{Course program:}
Brief history of data science.  Fundamental data concepts. Stages in a data science
project.  Data Infrastructure. Data integration from multiple sources. Data engineering
and shaping.  Inductive learning and principles of statistical learning theory.
Application of machine learning models in real-world problems.  Experimental planning for
data science. Model evaluation and Bayesian analysis.  Documentation and deployment.
Ethical and legal issues in data science.  Privacy-preserving computational approaches.

\paragraph{Goals:}
Providing the theoretical foundation and practical concepts to develop an end-to-end
data science project for an inductive task.

\paragraph{Teaching methodology:}
Expository classes in common classroom, using whiteboard, slide presentations, coding
examples, books, and scientific papers.  Supplementary didactic materials will be available
in Google Classroom. The development of the case study will occur during home study
hours, including programming and scientific paper writing.  All classes will be given in
English.  Students are encouraged to ask questions in English, but Portuguese is also
permitted. All written and oral assignments must be in English.

\paragraph{Grading:} Two individual written tests in the \nth{1} quarter ($T_1$ and $T_2$) and
another in the \nth{2} quarter ($T_3$).  Also, a group activity that includes writing a
scientific paper (optional), developing a data science product, and a 30-minute presentation ($L$).

Final grades will be calculated as
\begin{equation*}
  \text{\nth{1} Q} = \sqrt{T_1 T_2}\text{,} \qquad
  \text{\nth{2} Q} = \sqrt{T_3 L}\text{,} \qquad
  \text{Exam} = L\text{.}
\end{equation*}

\paragraph{Case study:} At most 6 groups will be formed.  Each group will be responsible for
a case study.  Students must choose a real-world problem and develop a data science
project, including data collection, data handling, inductive learning, validation,
documentation, and deployment. The results must be presented in a 30-minute presentation.
Extra points will be awarded to groups that write a scientific paper about the case study.
The trained models must be incorporated into a data science product, such as a web
application, a mobile application, or a web service.

\paragraph{Bibliography:}
\begin{itemize}
  \itemsep 0pt
  \item \fullcite{Zumel2019}.
  \item \fullcite{Wickham2023}.
  \item \fullcite{Kelleher2018}.
\end{itemize}

The first two books --- \textcite{Zumel2019,Wickham2023} --- are available online for free.

Any required extra material will be made available in Google Classroom.

Case studies will be presented during exam weeks.  At most 3 case studies will be
presented per day, with 30 minutes for each presentation and 20 minutes for questions.
